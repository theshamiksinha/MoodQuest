\begin{abstract}
Millions of individuals are affected by conditions such as anxiety, depression, and stress. While there are numerous mental support apps available, all of them struggle with user retention and motivation. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a gamified mental health app aimed at promoting emotional well-being and providing accessible support to users.
\\
The proposed app will use gamification techniques to enhance user engagement and motivation in managing their mental health. In addition to gamified elements, the app will offer therapy services delivered by qualified professionals through both online and offline sessions. Users will have the flexibility to choose from a range of therapy options, including chat, audio, and video sessions, tailored to their individual needs and preferences. The app will also provide access to supportive communities, resources, and educational content to foster a sense of connection, understanding, and empowerment among users.
\\
To ensure the effectiveness and relevance of the app, a comprehensive research and requirements-gathering process was undertaken. This included conducting interviews with a diverse sample of individuals. Additionally, an extensive review of academic literature, commercial products, and competitive analysis was conducted to gather insights into existing mental health solutions and identify areas for improvement.

\section{Motivation}
According to the World Health Organization \cite{WHOmentalhealth} (2022), Mental health is defined as the state of mental well-being when individuals effectively manage the challenges faced in daily life, recognise their capabilities, thrive, and make meaningful contributions to their communities. 

In recent years, people have become increasingly aware of the importance of mental health as a part of an individual's overall state of well-being. Along with it, the development of digital interventions to support individuals has also boomed. However, there still exists a significant gap between those who receive adequate mental health support and those who require it. According to the most recent national mental health survey, over 150 million Indians need mental health support. However, only 30 million people seek care \cite{Gautham2020}. Garg et al. \cite{Garg19} (2019) also suggests, there is a scarcity of mental health professionals, which, when coupled with people's reluctance to seek help, underscores the need for improved digital solutions that engage users.


\section{Problem Statement and Vision}

Our preliminary exploratory research leads us to believe that many existing technological solutions to the issues people face with mental health lack user retention. Many mental health apps are not based on concrete empirical research and a lot of them donâ€™t follow user-centric interaction design principles \cite{Balcombe2022}.

Through personas and scenarios, we aim to gauge motivations and pain points, mapping out a comprehensive picture of the problem. The end goal of this project is to design for a smooth user experience, taking inspiration from research-based principles such as gamification. Even at a rudimentary stage of research gamification shows a lot of promise by enhancing engagement, fun and interactivity Citation1 and we intend to delve deeper.

In the future, Mental health apps may have an important role to play in the evolution of traditional treatment and mental healthcare practices. This is primarily because the increasing democratization of technology will help combat the stigma associated with mental health issues \cite{IGIGlobal}.
 
\section{Proof of Significance}
Even though Mental health apps have been shown to be as effective as traditional mental services in improving mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, the engagement with these technologies is a big issue, and is typically way lower than traditional services \cite{Borghouts21}. Several studies have shown that these apps lose most of their users within the first two weeks after installation \cite{Auf21}. Furthermore, 74\% of users stop engaging with a health app after only 10 uses. In the top installed mental health apps on the app store, data analysis of user engagement data shows that the median of user-retention for the days 1,3 and 7 were respectively 50\% , 14.5\% , and 7\% \cite{Auf21}. Long-term engagement is especially difficult for these apps, due to the decreased motivation being a core feature of many mental illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia \cite{Torous18}.
\\
A mental app needs some form of dynamic sustainable engagement with a user to provide effective mental health services. This can be done by gamification of the app. Gamification uses the userâ€™s voluntary interaction with the system and its affordances to promote the user in a series of psychological outcomes, such as enhanced motivation and engagement, with the final aim of shaping his/her behaviors \cite{Bitrian21}.

\section{Literature Review}
\textit{\textbf{Problem Statement} - How can user-centric design choices and gamification elements be effectively integrated into a mental health application to improve user retention and engagement, addressing the gap between individuals seeking mental health support and those requiring it?}
\\\\
During a time of constant, fast-paced technological progress, we find ourselves in a new era that has seen a phenomenal rise in mental health awareness. Furthermore, while mental health has gained a lot of attention, there is still a considerable gap in the number of health professionals available to serve the needs of those who need it, as Garg et al. \cite{Garg19} (2019) pointed out. Digital interventions have therefore become instrumental in addressing the growing demand for accessible mental health support \cite{Borghouts21}. Better known as Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). DMHIs are technologies that provide mental health support to people through various means such as mobile apps, virtual reality platforms or internet websites. Mental health applications, in particular, have emerged as promising tools for delivering convenient and personalized interventions to individuals while ensuring the cost to achieve this is minimal  \cite{Baumel19}. However, the effectiveness and impact of such interventions are limited by their inability to engage users successfully for longer durations or before any notable changes may be observed \cite{Eysenbach05, Christensen06}.
\\ \\
Therefore, despite the proliferation of mental health applications, a significant challenge persists, i.e. user engagement and retention. Torous et al. \cite{Torous18} (2018) pointed out that while these applications hold immense potential for improving mental well-being, many users disengage from them shortly after initial use, limiting the impact and effectiveness of these interventions. Some of the reasons why users engaged in this behavior were the poor user-centric design of the application and the fact that the applications were not perceived to be trustworthy, among other things. This phenomenon of "Low Engagement" was not just limited to mental health applications but has also affected and still affects both traditional and computerized therapies for mental disorders \cite{Torous18}. Data from a market research study suggested that about 25\% of users abandon or uninstall an application just after one use \cite{AppUninstall}. Achieving Long-term engagement is therefore even more difficult. As an example, a study of an app to track asthma symptoms successfully enrolled nearly 8000 participants. Only 175 participants out of 8000 had engaged enough with the app in order to take a survey at the end of 6 months, which is just a minuscule 2\% (Chan et al., 2017, as cited in Torous et al.,2018) \cite{Torous18}.
\\ \\ 
The issue of low engagement is a complex issue to solve, and many factors are at play here. There is no one-stop solution to this problem. However, a step in the right direction would be focusing on the user interface design of the applications. User-centric design principles need to be incorporated into the development process. This approach will help us prioritize users' needs, preferences, and experiences, aiming to create intuitive, accessible, and engaging interfaces \cite{Vial22}. Unfortunately, many mental health applications have failed to adhere to these principles, resulting in interfaces that are cumbersome, unintuitive, or unappealing to users. Our goal should be to involve end users in the conception, design, and testing of apps. BitriÃ¥n et al \cite{Bitrian21} (2022) claimed close collaboration with the community to learn their needs and formulate how an app may even be useful would allow us to gauge better users' preferences and behaviors to create products that meet their expectations and enhance their experience
\\ \\
Many innovative solutions have been developed in the domain of user-centered design better to serve the needs and expectations of the people. One such approach that started gaining traction in the field, a few years ago, was integrating game-playing elements into applications. Also known as Gamification, it is described as the application of game design principles outside of gaming environments. A great example of an application that utilized principles of Gamification is Duolingo. It is a language learning app that awards points, levels, and virtual rewards for completing lessons and practicing regularly. An engaging feature it uses is the daily streak, where users can increase the streak they have held on the app by practicing and completing lessons regularly. This gives the users a sense of achievement and encourages them to continue practicing. Users earn experience points, unlock new levels, and compete with friends. Integration of such features can and has drastically increased user engagement and retention by leveraging intrinsic motivators and creating immersive experiences \cite{Bitrian21}.
\\ \\
Older studies regarding Gamification in mental health applications found that it was not used as a common strategy for promoting behavior change and improving mental well-being and that its effect on individuals needed to be studied, and further research was required \cite{Edwards16}. Cheng et al. \cite{Cheng19} (2019) also suggested that several gamification elements, like "randomness", "artificial challenge", "artificial assistance", "exploratory or open-world approaches", and "social cooperation", are underutilized in the domain and that further research is needed to know how these elements may be put to use to improve mental health and well-being, if at all.
\\ \\
Several newer studies have examined the effectiveness of Gamification in mental health applications, particularly in addressing conditions such as depression. A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Six et al. \cite{Six21} (2021) found that Gamification significantly improved user engagement and adherence to mental health interventions compared to non-gamified approaches. By incorporating rewards, challenges, progress tracking, and social interaction, gamified mental health apps foster a sense of achievement, enjoyment, and motivation among users, encouraging continued participation and interaction with the platform \cite{Bitrian21}.
\\ \\
Furthermore, qualitative studies have highlighted the potential of Gamification to facilitate engagement in universal school-based digital mental health solutions. By incorporating gamified elements such as points, levels, and badges, these interventions effectively capture the attention and interest of students, motivating them to participate actively in mental health promotion activities \cite{Badawi23}. Additionally, gamification techniques such as nudging have been proposed as effective strategies for improving user engagement in mental health and well-being interventions. By subtly influencing user behavior and decision-making, nudges encourage individuals to engage with the application and adopt positive health-related behaviors \cite{Auf21}.
\\ \\ 
In conclusion, while gamification presents a promising solution for enhancing user engagement in mental health applications, there are still several gaps in the existing literature. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of gamification on user engagement and mental health outcomes. Additionally, a large part of existing research is focused on the effectiveness of gamification in specific populations or contexts, like depression or school-based interventions. More studies are needed to determine the generalizability of findings across diverse populations. There is also almost no reliable data regarding potential drawbacks of gamification in mental health interventions, such as gaming addiction or increased stress levels. Addressing these gaps will contribute to a deeper understanding of gamification's potential and limitations in improving mental health interventions and user outcomes.

\section{Patents and Concepts Utilised}

Several key concepts and principles are used in the development of a gamified version of a mental health application. We have identified concepts from three main broader areas: User-Centered Design, Gamification and Digital Health and Behavioral Science. 
\\ \\
Robson et al. \cite{Robson15} (2015) point to the importance of incorporating game design elements into non-game contexts to increase user engagement. The application can then leverage motivational drivers such as autonomy, mastery, and purpose while integrating game mechanics like points, badges, and levels to provide feedback and encourage desired behaviors. Personalization based on user preferences and goals should be a central focus, ensuring that gamified elements resonate with individual users.
\\ \\
Conducting thorough user research also becomes paramount, enabling the identification of specific mental health needs, challenges, and preferences. Users should be actively involved through an iterative design process from initial concept development to usability testing. Personalization should extend beyond content to encompass the app's features and gamified elements, ensuring that the application is intuitive, accessible, and relevant to users of diverse backgrounds and abilities \cite{Schnall16}.
\\ \\
Finally, as highlighted by Eysenbach \cite{Eysenbach05} (2005) and Christensen and Mackinnon \cite{Christensen06} (2006), addressing the challenge of attrition requires strategic intervention to sustain user engagement over time. By understanding factors influencing attrition, such as usability issues, perceived lack of benefit, or competing demands, the application can implement strategies to promote continued usage. This includes ongoing monitoring of user engagement metrics and iterative app refinement based on user feedback and usage data. 
\\ \\
By integrating these principles into the development process, the gamified mental health application can effectively support users' mental well-being while fostering sustained engagement and positive outcomes.

\section{Interview Analysis (Qualitative)}
Click \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPaA-0VwmMxalHK1cTz1QMZmGF4sPHEAJa-ONISMrXk/edit}{here} to access the transcript.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Experience with Mental Health Apps:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most participants are aware of meditation and mindfulness apps, not mental health apps per se.
        \item People are generally very inconsistent in their usage of such apps. This discovery further fuels our conception that these apps lack user retention and engagement.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Mental Health and Gamification:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An understanding of what mental health and gamification mean to people.
        \item People relate mental health with emotional, psychological and social well-being.
        \item Participants described gamification as incorporating game-like elements into apps and other technologies with different contexts.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Perception of Gamification in Mental Health Apps:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is a unanimous agreement that gamification would make mental health apps more effective and fun to use.
        \item Most participants believe gamification has the potential to make these apps more interactive and convivial.
        \item Features such as challenges, rewards, progress tracking, animated interfaces, and leaderboards lead to piqued user interest.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Preferences and Needs:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Personalization of any technology makes it more desirable.
        \item One participant highlighted that looking for good therapists near him is painstaking.
        \item Social features like online support groups might be a good addon.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Frustrations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lack of consistently reliable information sources on mental health issues.
        \item Online solutions or platforms for dealing with mental health issues are often drab and not fun to use.
        \item The perceived utility of such apps is also poor.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Concerns and Suggestions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One big concern is that gamification might overshadow actual therapy-related content.
        \item Looking at stress, anxiety, and depression as parts of the same bracket might not be a good idea.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\newline
\textbf{Overall Analysis:} The analysis highlights users' perceptions of mental health apps. Generally speaking, people are neutral about using them (from what our survey data tells us). They have concerns about the effectiveness and concreteness of such solutions to mental health issues. Gamification is perceived positively, and people immediately relate to the concept and find it useful for enhancing engagement. The balance between gamification and the content of actual substance is another concern that users have. Additionally, users' preferences for personalized features emphasize the need for customization options to cater to diverse user needs and preferences.




\section{Survey Analysis}

Demographic questions relevant to our study:

\includegraphics[width=6.26806in,height=2.63889in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image1.png}

\includegraphics[width=6.26806in,height=2.63889in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image2.png}

We interviewed a good mix of people from different sections of the job
spectrum and age groups to paint a comprehensive picture. The sample may
be slightly biased, with the most responses coming in from students aged
18-24 because it is the most accessible section for us. Despite the
bias, the picture might not be skewed because the user base of such apps
includes a similar proportion of a young population, as shown below:

\includegraphics[width=3.74872in,height=2.12522in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image3.png}

The graph above shows how smartphone ownership and mental health app
downloads decrease with age

\includegraphics[width=6.26806in,height=2.63889in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image4.png}

This mapping of the responses is self-explanatory. Most people who took
our survey (65.4\%, to be precise) have experienced stress, anxiety, or
depression in their lifetime.

The interesting section here is the 25.2\% of people who responded with
``maybe.'' A staggering proportion of people do not know if they had
such issues in the past. Our app aims to help such people identify with
the common issues other people have faced or are still facing.

\includegraphics[width=6.26806in,height=3.66458in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image5.png}

Here, 31 respondents admitted to having no mental health support system
at all. An app might reduce the friction between these people and some
kind of help. Self-help books or workbooks are the most common resources
used in this regard. We aim to provide a curated collection of
literature on mental health and aid users in finding better resources.

\includegraphics[width=5.84259in,height=2.64943in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image6.png}

This question delves deeper into the reasons why people do not have
robust support systems. One of the biggest reasons is hesitance (also
misinformation). As mentioned earlier, an app might make it easier for
people to consult, say, a therapist over the internet for minor mental
health issues (some of which they may not even be aware of). The app
would also recommend well-reputed psychiatrists nearby for offline
consultation.

\includegraphics[width=6.26806in,height=2.63889in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image7.png}

\includegraphics[width=5.2037in,height=2.19079in]{vertopal.com_Survey analysis/vertopal_0d4ab446a1ae41f4824d7f0aaede9ca1/media/image8.png}

The data above is for mapping the perceived efficacy of mental health
apps. Most people have never used a mental health app before, although
during the interviews we realized that a lot of these people might have
used meditation apps or apps that help them with their well-being in
some way. We see this as untapped potential. Especially given that
mental health apps have seen definite growth recently.

``To meet growing demand and capture interested audiences, mental health
app creators and developers can pursue novel methods for monetization,
such as subscription tiers or tailored paid programs and offerings. They
could also explore personalizing these services for users and
customizing apps to encourage regular use and check-ins.''

We showed the respondents two interfaces. The one with checkpoints was
gamified. This helped us gather that people naturally like gamified
interfaces.

\section{Justification of Methods, Processes and Sources}

We adopted a mixed-methods research design to gather insights on the topic. The use of a mixed-methods design enabled us to combine qualitative and quantitative approaches, providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the research problem. A survey via Google Forms was circulated among people. This survey aimed to collect quantitative data on peoples' opinions on mental health and applications used to improve the same. The survey observed 107 responses. We have also carried out interviews with five individuals. The participants were recruited through snowball sampling. The interviews were conducted over Google Meet, and the interview transcripts were further analyzed. The interviewees provided both written and verbal consent for the interview.
\\ \\
Alternative approaches were considered, such as observational and diary studies, but interviews and surveys were selected for their ability to provide in-depth insights into user experiences and preferences.
\\ \\ 
\textbf{Survey} - Considering the standard survey design guidelines, a short and engaging online survey was designed. The survey explored multiple aspects of the topic at hand and the related context, such as the demographics of the participants (two questions), users' knowledge regarding and willingness to seek mental health (three questions), opinions on the use of mental health applications as a tool to improve mental well being (two questions) and user preferences regarding the user interface of the application (one question). Such themes were covered to enable us to establish the background of common user perceptions, challenges, and expectations from an application designed to help people improve their overall mental well-being. The estimated time of completion for the survey was 2-3 minutes, which assisted in preventing participants from avoiding the survey due to an excess of questions. The survey utilized single-select and multiselect options along with textual response fields wherever required, allowing qualitative and quantitative data to be collected. The survey was circulated among university students, working professionals, and other individuals using multiple channels, including private channels and word-of-mouth. Responses to the survey were analyzed and utilized further in the study to gain insights and to frame the interview questions.
\\ \\ 
\textbf{Interviews} - The interviews aimed to comprehend people's mental health needs, challenges, and preferences, providing qualitative insights into their experiences with existing mental health applications and services. Participants were encouraged to share their perspective on what mental health means to them, highlight their experience with any mental health applications, if any and list any features they would like to see in any such app if they were given a chance to use one. They were probed to share their opinions about the motivation behind a person using a mobile application regularly and what they understood by the term 'Gamification'. Semi-structured interviews conducted over Google Meet built upon the research questions established and refined using the initial findings from the survey. The interview maintained the survey's theme while enabling deeper insights due to its personalized, one-on-one nature, overcoming the limitations of the brief survey format. However, the sample population for the interviews lacked diversity, mainly comprising four college students and one school student, potentially introducing bias into the findings. A total of six questions were included in the structure of the interview.
\\ \\
\textbf{Data Analysis} - The interviews were transcribed word-for-word by the team members. This was followed by a Thematic Analysis of the collected data. The survey responses were coded and grouped under themes. The final themes from the surveys and interviews informed our findings and discussion.
\\ \\
\textbf{Literature review} - The literature review was conducted to provide a comprehensive understanding of existing research and knowledge relevant to the development of gamified mental health applications. A systematic search strategy was employed to ensure a thorough review, utilizing Google Scholar as the primary source for looking for relevant literature. The search strategy involved using Boolean expressions to refine search queries and narrow down results. Boolean operators such as "AND," "OR," and "NOT" were used to combine keywords and phrases related to gamification, mental health, user-centered design, and digital health interventions. For example, some of the search queries included combinations like "gamification AND mental health," "user-centered design OR digital health," and "mental health interventions NOT medication." We used Zotero to keep track of all the relevant articles and papers we collected.
\\ \\
Furthermore, papers with high citation counts were prioritized while selecting relevant literature, indicating their influence and relevance. 
In addition, a wide variety of sources were chosen, including journal articles, conference papers, online articles, blog posts, and other relevant sources of information. 
\\ \\
The literature review itself was divided into various stages. We first defined a problem statement for the study, which helped us clearly define the focus and purpose of the literature review. We then identified any themes and patterns from the literature collected. Lastly, we broadly divided the review into five parts: the introduction, the problem, the evidence, the solution and the conclusion. Each section served a specific purpose, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of existing knowledge and informing the development of the gamified mental health application.
